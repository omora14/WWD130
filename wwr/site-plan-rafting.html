    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
    <p>Palette URL:</p>
    <a href="https://coolors.co/253c78-5995ed-54f2f2-ffffff-0a369d"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/253c78-5995ed-54f2f2-ffffff-0a369d</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tr>
        <th>Primary</th>
        <th>Secondary</th>
        <th>Accent 1</th>
        <th>Accent 2</th>
      </tr>
      <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
      <tr>
        <td class="primary">[#0a369d]</td>
        <td class="secondary">[#253c78]</td>

      The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
      offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
      Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the

      Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
      physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
      adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
      happen for you.
